This is the replication package for the paper intitled "Code Review Practices for Infrastructure-as-Code: An
Empirical Study on OpenStack Projects". 

In this repository, we provide,

1) The script used to [``fetch the code review data from the review platform``](https://github.com/stilab-ets/iacreview/blob/main/Scripts/Fetch_OpenStack_Code_Review_Data.ipynb) and other custom scripts.
2) The fetched [``code review data for the OpenStack ecosystem``](https://github.com/stilab-ets/iacreview/tree/main/OpenStack_Code_Review_Data) from 2014 to 2021.
3) The data for [``the code review attributes per release``](https://github.com/stilab-ets/iacreview/tree/main/Code_Review_Attributes_Data_Per_Release) from the Kilo release till Victoria release for both IaC and Non-IaC code changes. 
4) The data for [``the code review attributes per phase``](https://github.com/stilab-ets/iacreview/tree/main/Code_Review_Attributes_Data_Per_Phase). For each release, we provide the code review attributes for the ``development`` (dev) phase, the ``release-candidate`` (RC) phase, and the ``post-release`` (PR) phase.
5) We also provide the [``survey``](https://github.com/stilab-ets/iacreview/blob/main/Survey.pdf) conducted with 9 OpenStack developers for the validation of our checklist .
